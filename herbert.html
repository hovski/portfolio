When I saw the news, I was ecstatic and wanted to be a part of designing a concept that could potentially work for their company — as well as an idea that would work for an entire package line. My goal for this package design wasn’t to change the companies brand – but to build something new and exciting!" text-colour2="blue-text" secondary-text="<i class="blue-text">This design is fictional and for educational purposes only.</i>" %}
{% pattern cards/mockup-right text="Herbert Works already began branding themselves with a clean look and feel. So I wanted to expand on this aspect and keep my design clean, but also sustainable! I thought about what would look different and enticing on a website or even on a shelf. As someone who buys products, I like to think about what haven't I seen or what do I rarely see and start there. That’s when it hit me – the cans had to be matte finished and the flavours should be inspired by something like beautiful sceneries." image="herbert/sketches-herbert.jpg" background-color="" text-color="" %}

These people have been at the helm of major shifts in economic and political standpoints. So I'll need the design to be relatable and also environmentally friendly. This means all cans will be 100% aluminum and printed with vegetable and soy-based inks. This will give them ease of mind by keeping a good carbon footprint.

{% pattern sections/project-fulltext background-colour="muteblue-background" text-colour="blue-text" text="I struggled with the design because I felt that the product should resemble the feeling that a user would have when experiencing the therapeutic effects of the product – as well as euphoria and relaxation. But I often kept going back to the thought that it was too inviting to a younger audience. But at the end of the day, I realized that these products wouldn’t be sold in stores and might only be purchased online like other cannabis products – and that gave me peace of mind with this creative concept.
