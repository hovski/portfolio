{% pattern sections/project-fulltext background-colour="muteblue-background" text-colour="blue-text" text="In September, Herbert Works was accepted to develop THC-infused beverages in Canada. When I saw the news, I was ecstatic and wanted to be a part of designing a concept that could potentially work for their company — as well as an idea that would work for an entire package line. My goal for this package design wasn’t to change the companies brand – but to build something new and exciting!" text-colour2="blue-text" secondary-text="This design is fictional and for educational purposes only." %}
{% pattern cards/mockup-right text="Herbert Works already began branding themselves with a clean look and feel. So I wanted to expand on this aspect and keep my design clean, but also sustainable! That’s when it hit me – the cans had to be clean, matte-finished cans. Where the flavours are inspired by beautiful sceneries." image="herbert/sketches-herbert.jpg" background-color="" text-color="" %}

{% pattern cards/mockup-left text="I needed to come up with an idea that could be used consistently for each beverage. So that's when Herbert — the yeti came into play. Herbert was going to become a mascot of sorts – where we could redesign him with different outfits for every different can flavouring." image="herbert/herbert.jpg" background-color="bkcolor-5" text-color="text-color2" %}
{% pattern sections/project-fulltext background-colour="" text-colour="dkblue-text" text="Messina Sans Pro is the real typeface for Herbert Works and since I didn’t own this font, I went with something that was super similar to keep the design as close to their brand identity as possible. I paired the typeface with a rounded font that would give it that clean geometric and soft minimalist feeling." text-colour2="Insert colour of text" secondary-text="Insert secondary text for project" hidden-class="hidden" %}

{% pattern sections/project-fulltext background-colour="" text-colour="" text="I kept thinking about who my demographic would be whenever I went on tweaking my concept. I knew that the consumers will be a mix of young professionals, millennials, and a bit of an older demographic. These people have been at the helm of major shifts in economic and political standpoints recently – so I had to make sure that whatever I designed it had to be calm, cool, and collected. I didn't want to rock any boats here. I wanted the design to be relatable for everyone – as well as something extremely environmentally friendly. That means the product will be constructed out of 100% aluminum and printed only with vegetable or soy-based inks. This will give consumers peace of mind by keeping a good carbon footprint!

{% pattern sections/project-fulltext background-colour="muteblue-background" text-colour="blue-text" text="I struggled with the design because I felt that the product should resemble the feeling that a user would have when experiencing the therapeutic effects of the product – as well as euphoria and relaxation. But I often kept going back to the thought that it was too inviting to a younger audience. But at the end of the day, I realized that these products wouldn’t be sold in stores and might only be purchased online like other cannabis products – and that gave me peace of mind with this creative concept.
