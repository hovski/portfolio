I decided to use Garamond as it’s a popular font used in print – but mostly because it’s an older font that readers can relate to. To offset this typeface, I needed something clean and modernized that was also soft. That made me think of Futura, but the rounded Futura. Something with soft edges but something geometric and easy to read because of its spaciousness – but it also offers that corporate feeling.

Overall, it worked out but in the future, I would probably measure ahead of time to save myself some time." text-colour2="Insert colour of text" secondary-text="Insert secondary text for project" hidden-class="hidden" %}
