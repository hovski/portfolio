I do love helping people, but I also like helping animals. I was given a task to recreate the World Animal Protections annual report. I started researching about them instantly and realized that I wanted to create an attractive annual report book that will give them the attention they truly deserve. One thing that stood out in all of my research was that the company prides itself on protecting wildlife from cruelty. So, I felt that if I was going to do anything with this book – I had to embrace a softer look with my layouts that showed that delicate side that animals and the environment can offer someone." text-colour2="" secondary-text="This design is fictional and for educational purposes only." %}
{% pattern cards/mockup-right text="I studied their old concept from front to back. It used their brands bolder orange tone and other darker color tones throughout its layout. I wanted to warm this report up – where when you're viewing the content it would make you feel like you were in the landscape. Peace and calm sensations would flow through you and make you want to keep flipping the pages to learn more about them. Similar to sceneries you’d see on your travels or when waiting in an office room – but in a different sort of way. For this to work, I realized the content had to contain lots of white space, a cleaner layout, multiple layout options, and tons of muted photographic pieces that contained beautiful animals they’re trying to save." image="animal/layoutideas.jpg" background-color="" text-color="" %}

I decided to use Garamond as it’s a popular typeface used in print – but mostly because it’s an older font that readers will respond too. To offset this font, I realized I needed something modern but soft. That made me think of Futura, but oddly enough – a rounded Futura. Something geometric, yet soft. It's easy to read due to its spaciousness – but it also offers that corporate feeling." text-colour2="Insert colour of text" secondary-text="Insert secondary text for project" hidden-class="hidden" %}

{% pattern cards/mockup-left text="While reading over my content, I kept closing my eyes and thinking about different destinations. Sometimes I'd read a few pages and think about what they're discussing – like that section about Dubai or even some of the farm animals they've saved. I kept wondering about what landscape images I'd use and how I'd lay the content out. Sections of this book were inspired strictly by photographs of animals in the wild or beautiful scenic landscapes I found. All the imagery is intended to appear softer to make the content easier to read through." image="animal/animal-cow.jpg" background-color="" text-color="" %}

{% pattern sections/project-fulltext background-colour="insert class name" text-colour="insert class name" text="I struggled with the layout design because I underestimated the content. There were sections throughout the book that were denser than others and I only accounted for 2 columns for most of the book. I had to incorporate the third column in some sections and it often made justifying text an issue. I had to adjust the margins later on and restructure my baseline grid to fix this issue. Overall, it worked out but in the future, I would probably measure ahead of time to save myself some time." text-colour2="Insert colour of text" secondary-text="Insert secondary text for project" hidden-class="hidden" %}
