While working there, I was able to test the limits for what I could accomplish with tight deadlines and large illustration needs. I got to redesign their festivals entire book on my own too. Luckily every day was something new and exciting to look forward to + I got to work with McMillian from time to time on different projects."  text-colour2="darkgrey-text" secondary-text="The pickle illustration is from the McMillian agency, all other illustrations are my own." %}

We had meetings and often met up to talk about different needs throughout their festival layout – one huge concern for them was to make that section stand out for families and kids. So we talked about designing illustrative spreads and color schemes that could relate with their audience." image="festival/sketchfestival-1.jpg" background-color="bkgcolor-1" text-color="insert class" %}

They wanted something empowering but also something that would include all genders & nationalities, but also something easy to read and relate to. For that reason, I used a new fun font that feels animated and circles of different colors that represented different people for both nationalities + genders.

I thought about night clubs and bar designs – and I always came back to the idea that it had to modernize with a bit of edge." hidden-class="hidden" %}
