While working there, I was able to test the limits for what I could accomplish with tight deadlines and large illustration needs. I got to redesign their festivals entire book on my own too. Luckily every day was something new and exciting to look forward to + I got to work with McMillian from time to time on different projects."  text-colour2="darkgrey-text" secondary-text="The pickle illustration is from the McMillian agency, all other illustrations are my own." %}

{% pattern cards/mockup-right text="Every single day was different there. Somedays I’d walk in and never know what I'd be working on and sometimes they'd surprise me with things they'd need on the fly. One of these projects was their Animation Exposé. We'd host in-house meetings and often met up to talk about a whole slew of different design needs throughout their festival layout. One huge concern for them was to make the Exposé section stand out for families and kids. So they let me design illustrative spreads and let me change color schemes that could relate with their target audience." image="festival/sketchfestival-1.jpg" background-color="bkgcolor-1" text-color="insert class" %}

{% pattern cards/mockup-right text="In another meeting, we discussed designing a new logo for their Animation Exposé. They wanted the logo to feel empowering but also something that would include all genders & nationalities. They wanted something neutral and accepting. For that reason, I used a more energetic font that feels a bit more animated – and circles are placed here with different colors to represent all the different individuals they mentioned. The circles are supposed to show the embrace and acceptance and everyone mingling at this event having fun." image="festival/logo-festival.jpg" background-color="bkcolor-7" text-color="text-color3" %}

They discussed how they wanted the section to be family-oriented – but different from the rest of the book's layout. At first, I started sketching random kids illustrations to get the juices flowing but, we needed Shaw's approval before I could do anything. After they gave us the go-ahead I was encouraged to design something that would relate to Shaw's brand. So eventually I came up with a space-themed page that is also kid friendly!" text-colour2="Insert colour of text" secondary-text="Insert secondary text for project" hidden-class="hidden" %}
