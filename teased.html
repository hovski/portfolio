But.. how often do you come across a tea brand that jumps out at you? Not often, but there's a couple. I decided that I wanted to give it a whirl and design a tea company that would entice tea drinkers in a more hip and edgy way. Lots of people nowadays are being influenced by pop culture and their often referencing scenes from movies or tv-shows. Since tea is becoming more popular than ever – I wanted to mix all of these ideas together and see what concoction I could come up with!" %}
{% pattern cards/mockup-right text="Let me start by saying, yes... I’ve fallen inlove with Adobe XD. You've caught me. It's just too good. You can literally design any website or app using XD with a blink of an eye. I'm often sketching out a ton of rough drafts on my iPad and then throwing them into XD to build things out quickly using symbols and character styles. It makes wireframing quick and painless! Often cases, my wireframes look more polished than they should because it's so great. Here’s one of my many wireframes I created for Teased!" image="teased/concept.jpg" background-color="bkcolor-8" text-color="text-color2" %}

I thought, this was something I wanted to tap into for my concept. I wanted to make a tea company and it's packaging labels entirely from something relating to pop-culture. There are tons of people who want to find the coolest tea shop or coffeeshop, blog about it, post images about what they ordered and what they bought, etc. Why not make a clean, cool looking tea package design that everyone would be raving about?" text-colour2="Insert colour of text" secondary-text="Insert secondary text for project" hidden-class="hidden" %}

{% pattern cards/mockup-right text="Want to know my biggest struggles? It was literally coming up with countless tea names. Seriously, I designed a whole slew of teas per tea strain and the naming was fun in the beginning – but over time it took some time and a lot of joking with friends to really get the ball rolling. I mean… Who wouldn’t want to drink “Jack Black”?" image="teased/mockup-phone1.jpg" background-color="bkgcolor-1" text-color="insert class" %}

{% pattern sections/project-fulltext background-colour="red-background" text-colour="white-text" text="Over time, I thought about all the different flavors for each tea and how they’d represent their name. I came up with descriptions and everything else. It was a fun design task I set out for myself, but I do want to come back to this design at some point to revamp the packaging a bit more. I feel it’s a bit too basic. The iconography was something I designed to go off of the whole zodiac approach... but for tea. I thought making iconography a bit straightforward and basic would be the right approach here, but I feel I went a little too basic and I'll go back to the drawing board for a revamp. I will say, I do plan on keeping it geometric in feeling so that it matches the typography from the logo. I’ll also come back to redesign the labels with geometric patterns throughout the colors for each strain." %}

Most consumers will be people who spend a great deal of time on social media and other online outlets. They strive on following trends and starting them.
