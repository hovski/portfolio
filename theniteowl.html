Well, imagine that but with a great business. When I found these guys online I couldn't stop researching them and understanding who they were. The Nite Owl is a barbershop that already has a good representation of who they are. They believe in being themselves and respecting others as they’d like to be treated no matter who you are or where you're from. Their social media explodes with personality and has that cool vintage look about them. When we got to our school's branding assignment, this was my chance! I wanted to redo their logo to keep it as authentic as possible, but with a cool illustrative twist." text-colour2="darkgrey-text" secondary-text="<i>This design is fictional and for educational purposes only. The client didn’t follow through with the design.</i>" %}
{% pattern cards/mockup-right text="For this rebrand, I wanted to create an illustrative logo that would embody the appearance of the owner Brian + the look of a night owl. I needed the logo to pay homage to Brian – since he brought that barbershop back to life over the years. While conceptualizing, I realized that this company values originality and that made this redesign a bit more tedious than I could have imagined." image="barbershop/sketches-barbershop.jpg" background-color="bkcolor-3" text-color="text-color2" %}

{% pattern sections/project-fulltext background-colour="lightgrey-background" text-colour="black-text" text="The typeface had to relate to this design or everything would flop and my idea of a revamp would be ruined. Over time, I realized that I could reuse the hand-painted lettering from their interior and mix it with a clean rounded san-serif typeface that would be legible from all age brackets. Something modern for the older audience, but also something relatable to the younger children that come into the shop as well. I was inspired to reuse their hand-lettering from their interior since they've only ever refurbished their shop without ever doing any hard renovations. I felt this would add that personal touch to the project." %}

But the shop also has kids from around the neighborhood that come in to get cuts for their grades – as well as a few old clients too! So this logo design was something that had to relate to all of the clients with a modern yet clean look in appearance. It had to match that personality you'd see on their social media." image="barbershop/owl-car.jpg" background-color="bkgcolor-1" text-color="insert class" %}
