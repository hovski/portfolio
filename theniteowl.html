{% pattern sections/project-fulltext background-colour="insert class name" text-colour="darkgrey-text" text="The Nite Owl is a barbershop that already has a good representation of what they want others to see them as. They believe in being themselves and respecting others as they’d like to be treated — so their clients often get treated with the utmost respect. That being said, their social media exudes with personality and has that cool vintage atmosphere experience. When looking into rebranding their logo, I wanted to keep their identity as authentic as possible, but revamp their image with an illustrative twist that stems from its roots."  text-colour2="darkgrey-text" secondary-text="This design is fictional and for educational purposes only. The client didn’t follow through with the design." %}
{% pattern cards/mockup-right text="For the logo, I wanted to create an illustrative design that would embody the appearance of the owner + a night owl combined. I needed the logo to pay homage to Brian since he brought the barbershop back to life. While conceptualizing, I realized that this company values originality and authenticity and that made the design a bit more tedious than I could have imagined." image="barbershop/sketches-barbershop.jpg" background-color="bkcolor-3" text-color="text-color2" %}

Over time, I realized that I could reuse the hand-painted lettering from their interior and mix it with a clean rounded san-serif typeface that would be legible from all age brackets. Something modern for the older audience but also relatable to the younger children that come into the shop as well." %}

But they also have kids from around the neighbourhood that get cuts for their grades and a few old clients as well. So the design had to relate to the clients with an old-fashioned, modern, clean look in appearance.

{% pattern cards/mockup-right text="The biggest struggles I faced with this rebrand was getting the illustration to match their vibe while keeping the companies spirit in check. I spent countless hours drawing over 80+ different variations of the new logo design until finally settling on the final two variations on the right.
