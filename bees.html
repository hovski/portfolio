Lots of people were designing in flat design illustrations or simple illustrations to get the point across. I wanted my poster to be bolder and something to touch base for adults and kids. I thought the more realistic approach would help the reader truly see what was disappearing and give it more meaning. As well as the more simple illustrations to make it more easy to navigate for kids to understand. But mainly so that it didn’t take away from the bees’ true purpose." %}

I wanted something thick and thin that would relate to a bees stripes. A font that was humanist and inviting to readers – and also something that readers of all ages could read with ease. I knew that Roboto was a good sans-serif font that people used to set body copy so I went with that at first. I decided to pair it with a heavier font like Objektiv Black." %}

The posters would be placed in offices and public health locations. The design can also be used in educational establishments and can be used to help promote environmental causes. The posters will be printed on recycled white poster paper using vegetable + soy-based inks. This will give people ease of mind by keeping a good carbon footprint." hidden-class="hidden" %}
{% pattern cards/mockup-right text="I struggled with mixing different drawing styles to make the idea work. If I had to go back and change things about this design, I’d most likely redo all of the illustrations and the layout. I wanted the bee to be in the center of the poster and everything flowed off of it with its text and it’s designed. When working on the project, nothing would work how I imagined and I had to keep restructuring the assignment to work after spending time drawing the bee." image="infographic/bee.jpg" background-color="bkgcolor-2" text-color="txtcolor-1" %}
