{% pattern cards/mockup-left text="I grew up gaming on an Atari and playing a ton of arcade games. When I was a kid, my dad would come home and we were glued to Duck Hunt for the rest of the night. I was someone who worked hard and dreamed bigger. I had no idea I wanted to work in the creative field, but everyone encouraged me including my best friend. Starting at a young age, I spent most of my time in my thoughts or doodling on desks to save some trees.... (yikes, sorry dad).

I’m a little all over the place and I usually have 50+ ideas before I settle with 1. I'll mindmap until nothing makes sense and then push even further than that where even I come back to my paper and nothing makes any sense. That's when I know I've come up with something and I start playing Jenga with different concepts till things start to come together." text-colour2="" secondary-text="Insert secondary text for project" hidden-class="hidden" %}

{% pattern cards/mockup-right text="After I swapped from doodling on desks to an iPad, things changed. Now I'm pretty much glued to my iPad and Cintiq. You'll always see me sketching out concepts in Procreate and swapping it over to tweak in Illustrator. This was the concept of how my mind works when coming up with a designing idea. I feel like, a lot of the fond memories and ideas I've come up with stem from my life experiences and that's how I merge my concepts into one." image="thoughtprocess/sketch-concept.jpg" background-color="bkgcolor-1" text-color="insert class" %}

I start pushing idea concepts from mashing things together I find amusing that could work with my project at hand.  Overtime, I’ll start to come up with an idea and then break that idea down into isolated shapes and concepts. String things together and get something a little out of the box.
