{% pattern sections/project-fulltext background-colour="" text-colour="" text="For our packaging assignment, I decided to do a revamped concept for Bedrocans packaging. There are tons of companies out there right now that are nailing their packaging for cannabis. I felt that Bedrocan deserved something fresh to appeal to its users since they’ve been helping people medicinally for over two decades – and that’s something I’m super passionate about." text-colour2="" secondary-text="This design is fictional and for educational purposes only.

{% pattern cards/mockup-right text="My ultimate goal was to come up with a solution for both making it environmentally friendly as well as improving its shelf life. Through research, I found a photo of the founders and felt that the company praises itself on being deeply rooted in history. I wanted to play off of that, and incorporate them through the design — as a pattern." image="bedrocan/founders.jpg" background-color="bkcolor-6" text-color="text-color2" %}

{% pattern sections/project-fulltext background-colour="" text-colour="" text="Other companies were already working towards sustainable solutions, and one even partnered up with a company called TerraCycle. Our packaging will be built 100% out of recycled goods from partnering up with TerraCycle as well. The cannabis would be stored in amber UV protected jars for sterilization purposes and to extend the product shelf life. All inks used would be printed in vegetable and soy-based inks. Boxes would be made using a thin layer of thermoplastic (melted down and remade through TerraCycle) and the polypropylene wraps would be PVC-Free. The inside has a cork insert to keep the jar from moving around and to protect the jar from damages." text-colour2="" secondary-text="" %}

{% pattern sections/project-fulltext background-colour="" text-colour="" text="I thought about current trends in the design world – where people are using slashed text and multicolored duotones. I wanted to use the image of the founders as the duotone throughout the packaging series to establish their long history. I kept Bedrocan’s typefaces and used their pre-existing logo. The colors used in the duotones are based on their pre-existing strains. All strains from this company and all other medical companies label their strains using color-coding. So I used that idea to show off the different package strain ideas." text-colour2="" secondary-text="" %}
