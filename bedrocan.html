There are tons of companies out there right now that are nailing their packaging for cannabis. I felt that Bedrocan deserved something fresh to appeal to its users since they’ve been helping people medicinally for over two decades – and that’s something I’m super passionate about." text-colour2="" secondary-text="This design is fictional and for educational purposes only.

{% pattern cards/mockup-right text="My ultimate goal for this package design was to come up with a solution for making it both environmentally friendly as well as improving its shelf life. Through research, I found a photo of the founders and realized that the company praises itself on being a family business that is deeply rooted in its employees and wants their business to grow. I wanted to play off of that, and incorporate the founders through the design — but as a duo-toned pattern." image="bedrocan/founders.jpg" background-color="bkcolor-6" text-color="text-color2" %}

{% pattern sections/project-fulltext background-colour="" text-colour="" text="Other companies were already working towards sustainable solutions, and one even partnered up with a company called TerraCycle. So for my packaging concept, I will be making it 100% out of recycled goods from partnering up with TerraCycle as well. The cannabis would be stored in amber UV protected jars – for sterilization purposes and to extend the product shelf life. All inks used in this redesign will be printed with vegetable and soy-based inks. All of the boxes will be made using a thin layer of thermoplastic (melted down and remade through TerraCycle) and the polypropylene wraps would be 100% PVC-free. Inside each box will have a cork insert to keep the jar from moving around and to protect the jar from future damages." text-colour2="" secondary-text="" %}

{% pattern sections/project-fulltext background-colour="" text-colour="" text="I surfed the web and spent countless hours to see what the current trends in the design world were. I noticed a trend where agencies and designers were using slashed text and multicolored duotones for photography. I thought about how I could incorporate the founders as a pattern, but then I realized I could make the founders into a duotone throughout the packaging series to show off its historic roots. I kept Bedrocan’s typefaces and used their pre-existing logo. The colors used in the duotones are based on their pre-existing strains. All strains from this company and all other medical companies label their strains using color-coding. So I used that idea to show off the different package strain ideas." text-colour2="" secondary-text="" %}

{% pattern sections/project-fulltext background-colour="" text-colour="" text="Surprisingly there's a ton of things I would change if I had to remake this project. I built the project by hand out of wood, since there was no way I could afford making a mold for the thermoplastic (yeah, I tried making it but it never came out smooth). I would love to try to find a way to make the entire box out of cork in the future. Corks super light in weight which means it would use fewer gas emissions than this current design. It's also non-allergenic, moisture resistant, and completely renewable/recyclable as a product. I'd like to figure out a way to make the caps of the jars out of cork too. At one point I debated using tin containers for cannabis, but I did worry about the shelf life aspect that I was first aiming for. I do think the glass jars are great for the product, but worry a little bit about offering some discretion to Bedrocan users." text-colour2="" secondary-text="" %}
