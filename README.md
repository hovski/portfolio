I am a graphic designer + photographer.

I honestly just fucking love breaking things apart with my bare hands and rebuilding them into something new and exciting.
I grew up in an old-school environment where you worked hard and dreamed about what could happen - never thinking it will happen. I spent most of my time in my head trying to come up with solutions for everything. I was the girl who genuinely cared about others, their problems, and how to fix things.

So come work with me so we can break your things and then make them better.
